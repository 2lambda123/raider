Getting Started
===============



Configure your first application
--------------------------------

Use the web proxy to check the traffic generated by the
application when you log in. Remove the HTTP requests that are
irrelevant to the authentication process, like the static files. Now,
the easiest way to proceed is by going backwards. Pick up one HTTP
request that can be completed only with an authenticated user, and try
to find out what piece of information in that request indicates the user
is authenticated by removing piece by piece the irrelevant
information. It's usually a header, a cookie, or both. Identify where
this piece of data comes from. Define it using Raider Plugins. When this
is done, move on to the next request, until you reach a HTTP request
that needs no inputs. At this point, the normal authentication flow is
complete. Expand the configuration to cover other flows (Multi-factor
authentication, bad credentials, etc...).
