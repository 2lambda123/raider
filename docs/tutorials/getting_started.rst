Getting Started
===============

Creating new project
--------------------

After you've installed Raider, you need to create a new project and
add hyfiles to define the information exchange. To create a new
project, run ``raider new`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Either give just a project name
   $ raider new project_name
   New file name (recommended in XX_name.hy format where XX=digits): 01_test.hy

   # Or both the project name and the file name
   $ raider new project_name 01_test.hy
   

And the file at ``~/.config/raider/projects/project_name/01_test.hy``
will be opened either in the text editor defined in the ``EDITOR``
environment variable, or default to ``vim``.

To begin, let's create a "Hello World" configuration first. This is
super easy, you only need to save this in the created file:

.. code-block:: hylang

   (print "Hello World")


And you can see the text printed when running Raider:   

.. code-block:: bash

   $ raider show
   project_name
       - 01_test.hy
   
   # Run the active project
   $ raider run
   Hello World
   CRITICAL:2022-12-11 00:06:42,527:raider - DEFAULT not defined, cannot run! (raider.py:89)

   # Same as above when only 1 project
   $ raider run project_name
   Hello World
   CRITICAL:2022-12-11 00:06:47,333:raider - DEFAULT not defined, cannot run! (raider.py:89)


Adding first Flow
-----------------
   
So besides printing the "Hello World" text it can't do anything
yet. To be able to run something with Raider, you need to at least
define one Flow.

Let's create another file 02_main.hy:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ raider new project_name 02_main.hy


And add the first Flow to it:

.. code-block:: hylang

   (print "main.hy")		
   (setv init
       (Flow
          (Request.get
            "https://example.com/")
          :operations [(Print.headers)]))
     

Running DEFAULT FlowGraph
-------------------------
	  
Now you can see it and run the defined HTTP request. The DEFAULT
FlowGraph is created to point to the first encountered Flow. hyfiles
are processed according to their alphabetical order.

.. code-block:: 

   $ raider show
   project_name
      - 01_test.hy
      - 02_main.hy
      - _project.hy

   $ raider show --flows --graphs
   Hello World
   main.hy
   project_name
       - 02_main.hy
           + DEFAULT -> initialization
             â€¢ initialization

   $ raider run
   Hello World
   main.hy

   CRITICAL:2022-12-11 00:21:04,978:raider - FlowGraph DEFAULT didn't return (Success). Exiting! (flowstore.py:188)

The CRITICAL error we still get is because when no Flow or FlowGraph
is specified in the ``raider run`` command, the DEFAULT FlowGraph is
used. However, since we've not defined a :class:`Success
<raider.operations.Success>` Operation the FlowGraph didn't
complete. To do so, we can edit the ``02_main.hy`` file like this:

.. code-block:: hylang

   (print "main.hy")		
   (setv initialization
       (Flow
          (Request.get
            "https://example.com/")
          :operations
	   [(Print.headers)
	    (Success)]))
     

Alternatively, you con run just by using the Flow name:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ raider run project_name initialization
   

Configure your first application
--------------------------------

Use the web proxy to check the traffic generated by the
application when you log in. Remove the HTTP requests that are
irrelevant to the authentication process, like the static files. Now,
the easiest way to proceed is by going backwards. Pick up one HTTP
request that can be completed only with an authenticated user, and try
to find out what piece of information in that request indicates the user
is authenticated by removing piece by piece the irrelevant
information. It's usually a header, a cookie, or both. Identify where
this piece of data comes from. Define it using Raider Plugins. When this
is done, move on to the next request, until you reach a HTTP request
that needs no inputs. At this point, the normal authentication flow is
complete. Expand the configuration to cover other flows (Multi-factor
authentication, bad credentials, etc...).
